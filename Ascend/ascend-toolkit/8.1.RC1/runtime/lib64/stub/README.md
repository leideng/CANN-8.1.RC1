# "stub"  usage:

## Description

- File libacl_cblas.so ,libacl_dvpp.so , libacl_retr.so ,libascendcl.so in this directory are used to comiple the code based on the ACL APIs.

# Attention

- Don't link other library except libacl_cblas.so ,libacl_dvpp.so , libacl_retr.so ,libascendcl.so. Linking unnecessary .so files may lead to compatibility problems during subsequent version upgrade.

# Usage

## Compile: compile the application invoking the ACL APIs.
